# A--Cinque-terre--model
Model and forecast

This is an interesting model developed in ANYLOGIC;
Model and prediction of the arrival and departure of people (tourists, etc..).
Arrivals/departures were modeled(with real time schedules): trains, boats and pedestrian routes between the different "lands" 
were modeled.
